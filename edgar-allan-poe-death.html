He was a star author who commanded great audiences for his readings, and he was about to marry his first love, Elmira Royster Shelton, following a short trip from Richmond to Philadelphia and then New York. Poe got as far as Baltimore before suddenly going off the grid, disappearing for nearly a week before turning up on October 3 in what was said to be a delirious state outside a tavern known as Gunner’s Hall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Poe was first found by a man named Joseph Walker, who recognized the famed author, deduced that he shouldn’t be dressed in someone else’s threadbare, ill-fitting clothing or convulsing in a gutter and offered to help. Walker asked Poe if he knew anyone nearby that he could contact and Poe mentioned an editor named Joseph Snodgrass. Walker <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eapoe.org/geninfo/poedeath.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote Snodgrass a letter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote Snodgrass a letter</a> urging his assistance. It read as follows:</p>“Dear Sir,<br>There is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear, at Ryan’s 4th ward polls, who goes under the cognomen of Edgar A. Poe, and who appears in great distress, & he says he is acquainted with you, and I assure you, he is in need of immediate assistance.<br>Yours, in haste,<br>JOS. W. WALKER<br>To Dr. J.E. Snodgrass.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From there, Poe was taken to Washington College Hospital, at which point things got murky both for the patient and the history books. Poe was kept alone in a windowless room with only one attendant physician, Dr. John Moran, to watch over him through what would be his final days. The week that he spent missing, the hysterical and haggard condition in which he was found, and the unreliability of the witnesses to his final moments and keepers of his legacy all contribute to over a century and a half of speculation and uncertainty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Poe died on October 7 at age 40, supposedly after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eapoe.org/geninfo/poerelig.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="uttering the last words" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">uttering the last words</a> “Lord, help my poor soul.” Theories about Poe’s death began cropping up almost immediately after it was announced.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There are no records remaining about his last hospitalization, but Poe was listed as succumbing to phrenitis, or congestion of the brain—a polite term often used for alcohol or drug overdoses at the time. There is suspicion around that cause of death, both due to the era’s less-than-precise medical treatment as well as the motivations of people involved.<br></p><h2 id=U.S.-Navy-Service data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Character assassination shaped Poe’s reputation following his death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Poe was, by many accounts, a lightweight when it came to liquor. People who knew him <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eapoe.org/geninfo/poealchl.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="didn’t recall him as a heavy drinker" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">didn’t recall him as a heavy drinker</a>—it seemed that he would go long stretches without taking a sip—but when he did imbibe, it didn’t take much for him to fall into a stupor. The death of his wife, Virginia, from tuberculosis in 1847 did send him into a long spiral, but he eventually recovered. After experiencing some close-calls and receiving advice from a doctor, Poe pledged his sobriety and joined the Sons of Temperance just a few months before his death.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Learn More About Edgar Allan Poe</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Snodgrass was a major advocate of the temperance movement and toured the country using Poe as an example of the dangers of booze; Snodgrass <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1851/18550726.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote that when he found Poe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote that when he found Poe</a> at the bar in Baltimore, the author was “utterly stupified with liquor” and could only produce “mere incoherent mutterings” in place of actual speech. Further, Griswold, who had an up-and-down relationship with Poe, used his position as the executor of his estate to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nps.gov/articles/poecharacterattack.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="write a libelous and, unfortunately, authorized" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">write a libelous and, unfortunately, authorized</a> biography that suggested the legendary author was an opium addict and drunkard.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moran, the Baltimore doctor who cared for Poe, saw this campaign in motion and did his best to clarify the circumstances surrounding Poe’s death. He said that Poe was in no way drunk when he showed up at the bar, and decades later, he wrote a book titled <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1851/jjm18850.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edgar Allan Poe: A Defense" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Edgar Allan Poe: A Defense</a>, which described a sober, steady Poe reciting poetry on his deathbed.</p><h2 id=U.S.-Navy-Service data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">There are plenty of other theories about Poe’s death</h2><img alt="a large headstone engraved with edgar allan poe and busts of the man" title="Edgar Allan Poe's grave in Baltimore" width=3283 height=3835 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-51697301.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Poe’s grave in Baltimore</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So if Poe didn’t succumb to the bottle, what did kill him? Again, we’ll never know—there was no autopsy performed to go back and review, and no contemporary accounts remain. But there have been theories for nearly as long as Poe has been dead, some of them more credible than others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some have speculated that Poe, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26473589 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="who adored cats" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">who adored cats</a> and had one as a pet, died of rabies. The symptoms seemed to match his delirious fits and the pattern of his decline in the hospital. In 1996, a researcher and professor at the University of Maryland Medical Center named Dr. R. Michael Benitez <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/us/poe-s-death-is-rewritten-as-case-of-rabies-not-telltale-alcohol.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="earned national attention" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">earned national attention</a> for this theory, which was worked out for a medical conference.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was, in part, based on Moran’s accounts of Poe’s time in the hospital, which indicated that Poe’s madness had ebbs and flows, with periods of lucidity in between spikes in feverish mania. Moran also noted that Poe was reluctant to drink water, which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1996-09-11-1996255015-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Benitez said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Benitez said</a> also matched up with symptoms of rabies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, Moran was something of an unreliable narrator, as comparisons of his various accounts reveal quite a few inconsistencies, partly because he wrote them so many years later.

This tactic involved kidnapping a man off the street, confining and potentially drugging him, then releasing him to repeatedly vote for a preferred candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After all, Poe was found on October 3, an election day for Marylanders to choose their Congressional representatives. One of the polling places was none other than Gunner’s Hall. Perhaps his odd clothing was part of a scheme to disguise his identity, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/03/26/edgar-allan-poe-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post reported" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“This was cold, damp early October in Baltimore,” Dawidziak told the newspaper. “If something was physically wrong with Poe, being cooped—kept in chilly and spartan conditions—could have been disastrous for his system. Add any amount of alcohol to the mix, and the effects would have been devastating.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Examining Poe’s remains—specifically, his skull—for signs of markings caused by meningitis could potentially give credence to the physiological aspects of Dawidziak’s theory.
