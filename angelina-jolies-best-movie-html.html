First up, Waller-Bridge joined the Childish Gambino (aka Donald Glover) in co-creating a series adaptation of 2005’s action spy comedy <a href=#>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</a>, starring Jolie and Brad Pitt, and now the Emmy-winning Fleabag creator is adapting Angelina Jolie’s Tomb Raider into an Amazon series, per <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>The newly announced project based on the popular video game and movie series, which starred Angelina Jolie, will adapt Tomb Raider in a new way that hasn’t been done before. Lara Croft’s character was originally crafted for the Tomb Raider <a href=#>video game</a>, which was released in 1996. The first movie hit theaters in 2001, a sequel was made in 2003, a film reboot was made in 2018, starring Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, and there has been a Netflix animated series, but this will be the first live-action series adaptation about the athletic archaeologist.</p><p>Waller-Bridge is set to write and executive produce the project along with Amanda Greenblatt and Ryan Andolina, who co-own a production company that partners with Amazon. Although Waller-Bridge will be starring in the upcoming <a href=#>Indiana Jones 5</a>, next to Harrison Ford, the filmmaker has no plans to star in this particular archeology adventure. No casting decisions have been announced at this point in the project, and it is too soon to know if Angelina Jolie may make an appearance in the new Tomb Raider adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>Adapting the character Angelina Jolie made famous more than 20 years ago in the first Tomb Raider film is the newest project in the works for the busy Waller-Bridge. The multi-talented filmmaker signed a new deal last year with Amazon after her previous contract neared expiration, and the production company didn’t want to risk losing her. As part of the new deal, Waller-Bridge will also be developing an adaptation of the book Sign Here by Claudia Lux, a comedic story about a guy who works in hell and is up for a promotion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tomb-raider-lara-croft-900x506.jpg><p>In addition to adapting Angelina Jolie’s Tomb Raider and Lux’s book Sign Here, Waller-Bridge is also working on an untitled Amazon project that is currently in pre-production. Neither Waller-Bridge nor Amazon have revealed any details about the project or disclosed whether it was a comedy, drama, or another genre. However, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that this project is entirely separate from Tomb Raider, and it will be a television series.</p><p>Before signing her second deal with <a href=#>Amazon</a> and agreeing to pen the script that will adapt Angelina Jolie’s most famous movie into a Tomb Raider streaming series, Waller-Bridge was known for her British-comedy Fleabag. The filmmaker both created and starred in the comedy about a sarcastic woman named Fleabag who navigates life and love in London while simultaneously trying to heal herself. The series won 6 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Waller-Bridge’s portrayal of Fleabag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iZnpyyrbXNmmSjp5yesrR5wZ6qrWWdpMOqsY2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-suzuki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Suzuki Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./9-12-weeks-1986.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 1/2 Weeks movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1986)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
