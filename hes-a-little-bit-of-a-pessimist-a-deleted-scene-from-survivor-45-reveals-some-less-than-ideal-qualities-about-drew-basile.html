He has a real problem with authority. He doesn’t like being told what to do,” prior to imitating Drew’s reactions to finding out they need to go to a challenge, they need to make rice, and more.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>“He’s a little bit of a pessimist, but he’s funny, you know?

I think that when you’re tall, I’ve heard the food deprivation hits a little bit differently.
