Besides bringing her success, her no-holds-barred humor helped Rivers form a surprising friendship with the then-<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-charles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Charles" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince Charles</a> and his wife <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/camilla-parker-bowles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall</a>. This friendship lasted from 2003 until the end of Rivers’ life in 2014.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Charles called Rivers ‘Miss Potty Mouth’</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2003, Rivers and Charles were introduced by mutual friends while on a painting vacation in the south of France. The heir to the British throne and the Brooklyn-born comedienne got along great. Rivers later told People magazine, “We sat next to each other at a dinner party and got friendly. He’s darling.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the course of her career Rivers had cracked jokes about the royal family, including one jibe that the size of Charles’ ears meant he’d never need a paddle to play ping-pong. Fortunately for her, Charles loved comedy, counting among his favorites Monty Python’s Flying Circus and comedian Peter Sellers, and therefore no jokes stood in the way of their developing connection. In fact, Charles enjoyed Rivers’ humor so much that he ended up giving her the nickname of “Miss Potty Mouth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After meeting Charles, Rivers also became friends with the prince’s longtime love, Camilla. Like Charles, Camilla enjoyed Rivers’ humor, exploding with laughter when Rivers offered to throw her a lingerie shower before the couple’s wedding. Rivers was at Windsor Castle to celebrate Charles and Camilla’s nuptials on April 9, 2005, one of just four Americans in attendance.</p><img alt="Joan Rivers at The Royal Wedding of HRH Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles" title="Joan Rivers at The Royal Wedding of HRH Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joan-rivers-during-the-royal-wedding-of-hrh-prince-charles-and-mrs-camilla-parker-bowles-photo-by-anwar-hussein-collectionrotawireimage-.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Joan Rivers at the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles in April 2005; Photo: Anwar Hussein Collection/ROTA/WireImage</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rivers became a staple at royal events</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to being a guest at Charles and Camilla’s wedding, Rivers took part in other royal events. In 2008, Charles’ 60th birthday celebrations included a “We Are Most Amused” comedy gala where Rivers performed. Another time, Rivers reportedly announced at a Buckingham Palace dinner, “I just want to say that this is for all you b*****s in the room who married your husbands for their money.” The prince laughed as Rivers continued, “I know who you are and Charles knows, too, because I’ve pointed you all out to him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rivers once brought fellow comedian Kathy Griffin as her guest to a two-night royal gathering: one evening at Windsor Castle, the next at Buckingham Palace. There, Griffin witnessed genuine affection between her friend and the prince. In her book Celebrity Run-Ins, Griffin wrote of Charles, “Seeing how obviously thrilled he was to see Joan that night was very moving.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rivers also got to be presented to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-elizabeth-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Elizabeth II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. It was a proud moment in Rivers’ life—and something she likely never would have experienced without her friendship with Charles.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Charles allowed Rivers to scatter her best friend’s ashes at his home</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their friendship went beyond performances and charity dinners. Rivers visited Balmoral Castle on another painting vacation and was a guest at the prince’s country estate of Highgrove. On one Highgrove visit, she asked Charles if she could scatter the ashes of her best friend Tommy Corcoran there. Charles agreed, another indication of how he valued Rivers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2010, Rivers gave New York Magazine a window into this friendship by talking about the prince’s Christmas gifts, which often consisted of two exquisite teacups: “One year I took a picture under my Christmas tree with the teacups and wrote, ‘How could you send me two teacups when I’m alone?’ Another time I wrote, ‘I’m enjoying tea with my best friend!,’ and I sent a picture of me in a cemetery.” Charles never directly acknowledged these photos, making her wonder if she should instead send regular thank-you notes—until she heard, via a mutual friend, that each year the prince eagerly anticipated Rivers’ response.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet even Rivers adhered to some of the limits of royal protocol. In 2013, before Charles’ first grandchild, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-george data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince George" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince George</a>, was born, Rivers admitted she’d held back from advising him about life as a grandparent. She told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/429633/joan-rivers-and-the-royal-baby-the-one-line-she-cannot-cross-with-prince-charles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="E! News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">E! News</a>, “When you are dealing with the royals, you have to know what line you cannot go over.”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rivers called Charles ‘charming’ and ‘humorous’ and he thinks she’s ‘irreplaceable’</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rivers once characterized her level of royal friendship as “not inner circle. Outer-inner circle.” This didn’t keep her from being a consistent and vocal defender of Charles. “He is so charming, so humorous. All the passions that everyone used to laugh at him for—organic food, architecture, talking to the flowers, we’re all into those things now,” she said in 2011. “He is so far ahead of his time, and I think he will be a very good monarch. He is a very smart man and I adore him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Rivers died on September 4, 2014—following complications during a routine medical procedure—her royal pals responded with their own public declaration of affection. A statement noted both Charles and Camilla were “deeply saddened” by Rivers’ death. It also included moving sentiments from Charles: “Joan Rivers was an extraordinary woman with an original and indefatigable spirit, an unstoppable sense of humour and an enormous zest for life. She will be hugely missed and utterly irreplaceable.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rivers would have preferred to stick around and keep making people laugh with her talent and hard work. However, having her death recognized by her friends in the royal family is the kind of acknowledgment she would have wanted. When she embarked upon her comedy career, she probably never imagined where it would take her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmiin5a7br7Ir5yrq12lv6q6wp5knKCRp7mmv4yfqaKdnpnAqbXP</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deep-purple-perfect-strangers-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deep Purple Perfect Strangers Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gia-francesca-lopez-mario-lopez-daughter-courtney-laine-mazza.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Gia Francesca Lopez Photos Of Mario Lopezs Daughter With Courtney Laine Mazza,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
