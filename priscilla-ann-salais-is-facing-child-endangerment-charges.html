Salais, who had legal custody of the children but is not their mother, was detained on Tuesday after a witness urged police on Saturday to do a welfare check on the children, a 1-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy.</p><p>Police claimed they discovered the girl “hogtied” and suffering from physical harm inside, while the kid was reportedly imprisoned in a cage. When officials came, both youngsters were stated to be “heavily filthy” and weeping.&nbsp;Salais was charged with two charges of child endangerment on Tuesday, and as officers brought her to a Bexar County prison, she told reporters that the claims were “bulls—t.”</p><h2>Toddlers Suspected of Being ‘Hogtied,’ Beaten</h2><p>On Saturday, San Antonio police said they received a 911 call from a mother who stated her grandkids were confined in a bedroom in Salais’ Highland Park house. When firemen arrived, they pushed their way into the room, where they claimed to have discovered two children. A one-year-old daughter was found on the floor with her wrists and feet bound together. According to an arrest document acquired by KSAT, the child had “obvious injuries,” including a black eye and a bloodied lip.&nbsp;A 2-year-old kid was allegedly kept in a playpen “totally covered” by a table and a baby carrier, resulting in a makeshift cage.&nbsp;“Both youngsters were highly soiled and wailing,” said Police Chief William McManus.</p><p></p><p>“Both youngsters were arrested and given over to CPS [Child Protective Services].”&nbsp;The children were temporarily put in Salais’ care while CPS investigated their parents for suspicions of physical abuse, according to the affidavit. According to KSAT, the children’s mother, a lady named Isabella, is Salais’ stepdaughter.&nbsp;“Tell [the toddlers] that I’m sorry, that I should never have trusted anybody with them, and that I just want them to come home immediately,” Isabella told the source.&nbsp;It’s unclear why the children were sent to Salais, who authorities say isn’t qualified to foster children in Texas.</p><h2>Priscilla Ann Salais is charged with two felonies.</h2><p>Salais was detained on two charges of felony child endangerment, according to online prison records. Chief McManus said the 37-year-old might face years in prison if convicted. Her bond seems to be set at $75,000 for each count. However, this might be a placeholder number given that she has yet to be arraigned. It is unclear when Salais will appear in court to address the allegations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Priscilla-Ann-Salais.png alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Child endangerment entails a maximum punishment of two years, but I’ll tell you what she did to these children is inexcusable,” he told reporters on Tuesday.&nbsp;“Two years seems nothing in comparison to what she did to these children.”&nbsp;Salais told reporters as she was led to a squad vehicle outside a San Antonio police station on Tuesday that they needed to “get [their] facts right.” She called the claims “bulls—t” and invited reporters to speak with her grandma.</p><p>According to one account, Salais’ father also denied the charges.&nbsp;“The kids she’s taken in out of the goodness of her heart are because that’s the sort of person she is,” he told KSAT.&nbsp;“Now, this sensationalized portrayal of her that is being depicted is just wrong.”</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Priscilla Ann Salais</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Priscilla Ann Salais crime</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinq6GjmLatuMBmmKemXaiura3IrGSiq12brqS1zaBknKCZobFusc2dmKeflae6prrTZpqhmaKcsrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-catherine-suh-today-wikipedia-parents-and-boyfriend-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Catherine Suh Today?
