Hutchins died from her injuries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The actor and the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, were each charged with involuntary manslaughter in January 2023. Baldwin’s charges were dropped three months later when special investigators said there were “new facts” that needed further investigation. But in January 2024, a New Mexico grand jury voted to again charge Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, the actor faces up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin has maintained he didn’t pull the trigger.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reed’s trial is set to begin in February 2024.
