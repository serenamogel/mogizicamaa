However, they were ambushed by the Dark Heaven members, who were also after the artifact. Hansoo used his skills and items to fight back, but he realized that the enemies were too strong and numerous. He decided to use his trump card, the Dragon’s Breath, which was a powerful skill that could wipe out the enemies in one blow.</p><p>However, he also knew that the skill had a drawback, which was that it consumed a lot of his mana and stamina, and left him vulnerable for a while. He decided to take the risk and activated the skill, hoping to end the battle quickly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cheongang and Taekyung were on their way to the Shaolin Temple, where they expected to find Jong Richu and the green jade ruyi. They were also worried about Hansoo, who had gone ahead of them. They hoped that he was safe and that he could get the artifact before the enemies. However, they were unaware that the Shaolin Temple was already under attack by Jong Richu and his allies, who had managed to infiltrate the place with the help of a traitor.</p><p>The traitor was none other than the muscular monk, who had betrayed Hongdao and the Shaolin Temple for his own greed. He had given the green jade ruyi to Jong Richu, who planned to use it to become the strongest in Murim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Murim-Login-Chapter-175-spoiler.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Raw_Scan_Release_Date></span><strong>Raw Scan Release Date </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The raw scan for Murim Login Chapter 175 will be available on the same day as the official chapter, which is November 12, 2023.
