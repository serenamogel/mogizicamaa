The Grammy-nominated crooner began her ascend with her debut song, <i>Under the Sheets</i>, in 2009, and through an apparent figure compared to her fellow pop stars, Goulding has been only climbing her way up since. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on December 30, 1986, in Hereford, England, Ellie's electropop, and indie-pop songs have kept us entertained for more than a decade. The Brit, a soprano at root, has released a myriad of chart-topping hits while keeping it relatively away from the glitz and glare of the glamour world. Here's everything to know about her married life. &nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Ellie Goulding's Marital Life! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>As she navigated a soaring career in the industry, Ellie&nbsp;Goulding is also anchoring a thriving personal life. The once-eligible bachelorette is now a happy wife and doting mother.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/21/316091836_1569406626823563_5298195782236523970_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684685597976.jpg><p>Goulding married art dealer <strong>Caspar Jopling</strong> in 2019 and has been living a quiet, off-the-grid life with him. The Brit and her leading man were first linked in April 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>After little to no substantial evidence of their romance, the buzz shifted and so did the curiosity. But then came the sudden engagement announcement from the <i>Love Me Like You Do</i> hitmaker in August 2018. &nbsp;</p><p>The low-profile couple's engagement was announced via <a href=#>The Times</a>. While disclosure posed many questions for the newly engaged, they held their ground and carried on with their away-from-the-spotlight romance.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ellie Goulding's Wedding Was A Spectacle!</h2><p>The singer and art dealer pair <a href=#>tied the knot</a> on August 31, 2019, at York Minster. The duo's extravagant nuptial was a star-studded affair. Ellie Goulding and her beau, Casper Jopling, wedded in a wedding of the decades with varying stars as an attendee!</p><p>Yet the guest list was one packed with star power! The attendees for the wedding include <strong>Princess Beatrice, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, Princess Eugenie, Jack Brooksbank, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom</strong>, and more.</p><p>Although the pair hardly talk about their life as a married couple, both Ellie and Caspar have made some exceptions over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/21/265267426_650399709469129_3573318718577899702_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684685604816.jpg><p>More recently, the English art dealer gushed about his famous wife in an Instagram post. Jopling wrote a heartfelt appreciation for Goulding and expressed his ever-growing love for her.&nbsp;</p><p>"I love you even more than I did a year ago; thanks a million for everything you do. You're pretty f**** grand," the caption read.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Close to Me</i> singer has also reflected on her love story a handful of times. In 2020, Goulding unpacked the beginning of her what appeared to be a whirlwind romance.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>singer said </a>it took her and Jopling months before getting comfortable around each other. Likewise, Ellie and Casper started dating after many meets and greets. &nbsp;</p><h3>Learn about Ellie Goulding's Husband and Their Kids! &nbsp;</h3><p>Ellie Goulding's previous flames were from the industry and therefore didn't need any introductions. But the name Caspar Jopling aroused many questions at first. Fans have since learned that guy is no less accomplished in his ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/21/131300332_859928624579597_6995266956110505068_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684685798792.jpg><p>Jopling, needless to say, comes from an affluent background. He may be known by his wife's credits worldwide, but it could be the other way around in the duo's native.</p><p>Jopling went to the esteemed Eton school. The same place as <strong>Prince Harry</strong> and <strong>Prince William </strong>attended. He even has a degree in history of art and architecture from Harvard. Not to mention an MBA degree from Oxford.&nbsp;</p><p>Casper works as an art consultant at Sotheby’s. After marrying the woman of his dreams in 2019, Jopling wasted no time venturing into fatherhood! Goulding and her husband welcomed a son, <strong>Arthur</strong>, in February 2021. &nbsp;</p><p>Ellie and Jopling's only son turned two earlier this year, and as expected, the first-time parents are following the protective parent approach. Ellie has been candid about her motherhood journey and how it changed her as a person. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Goulding says motherhood made her feel more human!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>During her conversation <a href=#>with Vogue </a>after the birth of her son, Goulding shared how they didn't plan on their first pregnancy. The mother of one has, however, cherished the outcome more than she could describe. Goulding said that becoming a mother made her feel more human. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Ellie Goulding's Dating History! &nbsp;</h3><p>Fans would recall when Goulding's love life sparked as much buzz as any other star. The Grammy-nominated crooner might have come far and beyond those days, but the stories are still one click away. The Brit's last boyfriend happens to be her former trainer, <strong>Bobby Rich</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/21/333522238_549846363668834_1468555817400209599_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684685629645.jpg><p>Goulding and Rich began a hasty romance in late 2016, and by early 2017, it fizzled out. Ellie's fair share of romances also includes unconfirmed rumored affairs. She was famously linked with <strong>Prince Harry</strong> in 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>Goulding's other notable relationship was with former McFly band member <strong>Dougie Poynter</strong>. Ellie and Dougie dated on and off for years until 2016. The <i>Love Me Like You Do </i>singer's earliest known boyfriend is DJ <strong>Greg James, </strong>who she dated for nearly two years. &nbsp;</p><p>In Ellie's early years, the singer romanced DJ <strong>Skrillex</strong>, actor <strong>Jeremy Irvine</strong>, and <strong>Calvin Harris</strong>. Despite fans' extensive theory on her romantic stint with <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong>, Goulding has vehemently denied the dating rumor between her and Ed.</p><p>Fans believed the Brit dated Ed at one point and cheated on him with <strong>Niall Horan</strong>. While Goulding admits to going on a few dates with the One Direction fame, she has refuted the numerous claims about her involvement with Sheeran.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/21/187582359_605421103748418_6205189631422354677_n%20(1)%20(1)-1684685642843.jpg><p>The Grammy nominee has even gone to lengths<a href=#> to say</a> that the vicious rumor caused her a lot of trauma and hurt her career. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqmuMuinGafn6q5pbXNoGSmmaKntqawjK2mZqGeqLalsYyhnKtloJq%2FtLvNmqNmpJmbsg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./janelle-ginestra-net-worth-154095.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Janelle Ginestra Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cherry-almond-granola-bars.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cherry Almond Granola Bars - Mom On Timeout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
