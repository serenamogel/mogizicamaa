In 2006, after being drafted to ECW, Angle adopted the 'Wrestling Machine' gimmick where he would put on a mouthguard and use his 'wrestling skills' to grapple and run through his opponents one after the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kurt Angle's 5 Best Matches As A Heel (& His 5 Best As A Face)</a></span></p><p>Although it was a gimmick, the fans really bought into this new character and it stuck with him even after leaving WWE during his original run.

Similar to Angle, Brock also has a good history with amateur wrestling. During his initial run with WWE during the Attitude Era, he was touted as The Next Big Thing where he was portrayed as a powerhouse athlete who would maul his opponents; even opponents like The Big Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of his aggressive and beast-like nature inside the ring, he was nicknamed The Beast Incarnate or simply, The Beast. <a href=#>His record in UFC</a> further adds to his testament.

The nickname hints at how the current COO of the WWE saw himself as not a student of the game or not even the best in the game but as the game itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Triple H went on to have an amazing career where he successfully transitioned from a professional wrestler to an authority figure to changing the entire landscape of the WWE by handling NXT.</p><h2 id=jeff-hardy-the-charismatic-enigma><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jeff Hardy: The Charismatic Enigma</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Charismatic-Enigma-Jeff-Hardy.jpg><p>One of the best high flyers in the industry of all time, Jeff Hardy is a true daredevil. He has shown time and again that he is not afraid to take risks and up the ante every time he steps inside the squared circle. This <a href=#>makes him highly unpredictable</a> as he is ready to climb any heights to crash onto his opponents.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Version Of Jeff Hardy, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Hardy is an extremely likeable character - he was and is well received by the WWE fans.

WWE Hall Of Famer, Edge did not earn this nickname overnight as this was a culmination of his character work, in-ring skills and some risque storylines that clearly were not PG.</p><p>His run with The Brood, a cult faction where the members were portrayed as vampires (in a cool way), his fearless moves in the TLC matches with The Hardys and The Dudleys, his controversial love triangle storyline involving Lita and Matt Hardy and the eventual WWE Championship celebration on Raw where Lita and Edge made love.

But one nickname that always stood out was also the one that appears on the titantron when his music hits i.e. HBK; Heartbreak Kid.</p><p>Back in the early '90s, Shawn was in his heel run when he was managed by Miss Sherri, who was in love with the former. Shawn eventually turned on her thus, breaking her heart in the process. He was portrayed as this handsome guy who has broken the hearts of many girls and at the same time, the hearts of many fans by defeating the popular babyfaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-orton-the-viper><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Randy Orton: The Viper</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Viper-Randy-Orton.png><p>A future Hall Of Famer, WWE's resident Apex Predator, Randy Orton has been compared to a viper for well over a decade, mainly due to how he slithers in the ring and stalks his opponents before catching them off guard when he hits them with the three most deadliest letters in history; <a href=#>RKO</a>.</p><p>Just like how a viper attacks its prey from out of nowhere, Randy has built a reputation of hitting the <a href=#>RKO on his opponents from out of, nowhere</a> and anywhere; in the most unexpected of times, his most recent one being a Uso Splash being converted into an RKO mid-air at the 2021 Survivor Series PPV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aj-styles-the-phenomenal-one><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>AJ Styles: The Phenomenal One</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Phenomenal-AJ-Styles.jpg><p>The former leader of The Bullet Club and arguable one of the best professional wrestlers of all time, AJ Styles is often referred to as The Phenomenal One inside the ring and rightfully so. At 44, he still moves like a 20-year old and <a href=#>performs aerial and mat-based moves</a> which put him at an elite level.</p><p>Based on Styles himself, he was given the nickname by one of the commentators when he was wrestling at a place called Wildside in 2000/2001 and the name stuck ever since.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-lionheart><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chris Jericho: Lionheart</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lionheart-Chris-Jericho.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Did you know Chris Jericho has more than 10 nicknames, including Y2J, The Ayatollah Of Rock 'n Rolla and Le Champion?

A few months after his debut on SmackDown, he debuted the Doctor Of Thuganomics gimmick which is him <a href=#>trash-talking about his opponents</a> and it quickly got him over with the WWE Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gimmick is a funny take on Doctor of Economics and when fused with the word Thug, John Cena is officially a Doctorate or a PhD holder in Thuganomics.
