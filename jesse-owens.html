The son of a sharecropper and the grandson of enslaved people, Owens was a frail child who was often sick from battles with chronic bronchial congestion and pneumonia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, he was expected to work, and at the young age of seven he was picking up to 100 pounds of cotton a day to help his family put food on the table.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of nine, Owens moved with his family to Cleveland, Ohio, where the young "J.C." discovered a world far different than the slower, Southern life he'd known. School proved to be one of the bigger changes. Gone was the one-room schoolhouse he'd attended in Alabama, replaced by a bigger setting with stricter teachers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Here, Owens earned the nickname that would stick with him the rest of his life: One of his instructors, unable to decipher his thick southern accent, believed the young athlete said his name was "Jesse," when he, in fact, had said "J.C."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Rising Track and Field Star" data-anchor-id=rising-track-and-field-star class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Rising Track and Field Star</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At East Technical High School, Owens quickly made a name for himself as a nationally recognized sprinter, setting records in the 100 and 200-yard dashes as well as the long jump. After graduating, Owens enrolled at Ohio State University, where he continued to flourish as an athlete.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the 1935 Big Ten Championships, the "Buckeye Bullet," as he was also known, overcame a severe tailbone injury and tied a world record in the 100-yard dash—and set a long jump record of 26-8 ¼ that would stand for 25 years. Owens also set new world marks in the 220-yard dash and in the 220-yard low hurdles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His dominance at the Big Ten games was par for the course for Owens that year, which saw him win four events at the NCAA Championships, two events at the AAU Championships and three others at the Olympic trials. In all, Owens competed in 42 events that year, winning them all.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="1936 Olympics" data-anchor-id=1936-olympics class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">1936 Olympics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/adolf-hitler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adolf Hitler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Adolf Hitler</a> and the Nazis, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.olympic.org/berlin-1936 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1936 Berlin Olympic Games" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">1936 Berlin Olympic Games</a> were expected to be a German showcase and a statement for Aryan supremacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hitler lambasted America for including Black athletes on its Olympic roster.

After Owens won the 100-meter event, a furious Hitler stormed out of the stadium, though some reports indicate that Hitler later congratulated the athlete on his success.<br></p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=24 title="Jesse Owens and Racism" data-anchor-id=jesse-owens-and-racism class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Jesse Owens and Racism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Owens helped the United States triumph at the games, his return home was not met with the kind of fanfare one might expect. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Franklin D.

"When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn't ride in the front of the bus," he said. "I had to go to the back door. I couldn't live where I wanted.

The struggles within yourself—the invisible, inevitable battles inside all of us—that’s where it’s at.</li><li>I wanted no part of politics. And I wasn’t in Berlin to compete against any one athlete. The purpose of the Olympics, anyway, was to do your best. As I’d learned long ago… the only victory that counts is the one over yourself.</li><li>I loved [running] because it was something you could do all by yourself, and under your own power.</li><li>I think the greatest moment that a person can have is to stand on a victory stand, far away from home, and then, from the distance you can hear the strains of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’</li><li>All we athletes get out of this Olympic business is a view out of a train or airplane window. It gets very tiresome, it really does.</li><li>If I had to do it all over again, I probably would. More people have been kind to me than not, and they have looked upon my accomplishments more than the color of my skin.</li><li>Awards become tarnished, and diplomas fade… Championships are mythical things. They have no permanence.</li><li>In America, anyone can become somebody. Does that sound corny in this day and age? Well, it happened to me, and I believe it can happen to anybody in one way or another.</li><li>Success is not easily achieved. Be prepared for sacrifice. Work hard. Take instruction... There is no shortcut to the ultimate goal.</li><li>You see, Black isn’t beautiful. White isn’t beautiful. Skin-deep is never beautiful.</li><li>One chance is all you need.</li><li>We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline and effort.</li><li>Awards become corroded, friends gather no dust.</li><li>When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn’t ride in the front of the bus. I had to go to the back door. I couldn’t live where I wanted. I wasn’t invited to shake hands with Hitler, but I wasn’t invited to the White House to shake hands with the president, either.</li></ul>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
