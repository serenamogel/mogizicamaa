May this be your best year yet!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Before attending Brian’s party and having a mini reunion with her former 90210 costars, Shannen made headlines for documenting the latest part of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health journey</a>. In June, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she revealed</a> that after being diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in 2020, it had spread to her brain, in a post. She also talked about the tests and treatment she had to have for it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“On January 5th, my CT scan showed Mets [metastasis] in my brain. Yesterday’s video was showing the process of getting fitted for the mask which you wear during radiation to your brain. January 12, the first round of radiation took place,” she wrote in a caption for a video she shared on June 6. She also openly talked about her “fear” during the process.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Shannen’s battled cancer on and off since 2015, when she was first diagnosed, and has been very open about discussing the physical and emotional difficulties, in an attempt to help others. “A lot of people who get diagnosed with Stage IV, they sort of get written off,” she&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said after her cancer returned</a>. “It’s assumed that they cannot work or they can’t work at their full capacity, and that is not true. That is something that I would really like for people to stop assuming and give us a chance to prove them wrong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BvZqygkaO7prqMnaahnaKpxm6u0aKYp2WRqsC1tc1mnqudlaN6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalir6bCxKujsmWYnrmtv4xyZ2tpYGK%2FpsHNoqanZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blood-red-sky.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blood Red Sky Cast, Actors, Producer, Director, Roles, Salary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-michaels-do-photo-printing-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Michaels do photo printing?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
