Sir Tiuri is so focused on getting his adopted son to knighthood that he even rigs a competition, ultimately causing him to be looked down upon by his peers. When Tiuri participates in sacred knight training with his fellow wannabe knights one evening, Tiuri goes rogue from the group&nbsp;to assist an old man pleading for help,&nbsp;one of the story’s first examples of a decent theme about the courage it takes to do the right thing. But Tiuri finds himself responsible for an important letter, handed to him by a soon-to-be-dead&nbsp;man called The Black Knight (<a href=#>Ben Chaplin</a>). We don’t know exactly what the letter says until later (and it becomes one of the less exciting Maguffins in recent storytelling history), but we know that it came from the menacing Prince Viridian of Unauwen (Gijs Blom), who just won a major victory.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Every now and then, the show cuts back and forth to show that he is&nbsp;up to no good (like when he murders a shaman and breathes in their powers, for starters), and it becomes one of the series' many flat portrayals of villainy.&nbsp;</p><p>The drama of&nbsp;“The Letter for the King” concerns three kingdoms—Evellian (where Tiuri is originally from), Dagonaut (where Tiuri was raised by his mother and stepfather), and Unauwen (where the letter must go). Even for just three kingdoms, the series can be a little exhausting when keeping track of&nbsp;who is from where (a “Game of Thrones”-like recap might have benefited this series in particular, something Netflix seems largely defiant of). But once you get the gist, “The Letter for the King” can be pretty straightforward—a wide-screen quest through some inspired locations (like a monastery at the top of a mountain), with Tiuri soon receiving help from a princess of Dagonaut named Lavinia (Ruby Ashbourne Serkis), who was originally intended to be married off by her father (<a href=#>Andy Serkis</a>, in a fleeting appearance). They’re the main duo (along with tenacious steed Ardanwen) that travels with the letter to get it to said king, while being chased by Viridian’s Red Riders through the snowy&nbsp;mountains, onto a boat, and toward the kingdom of Unauwen.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5e78be00646d6a3aa607d3b7/content_letter-for-the-king-image.jpg><p>Tiuri's peers are also on his tail, like the lute-playing goofball Jussipo (<a href=#>Jonah Lees</a>), and the lionhearted Iona (Thaddea Graham). They've been ordered by their superiors to find Tiuri and the letter, and though they are not particularly villainous, they go along with it.&nbsp;Their own quest provides some padding to the adventure, and some weak (however welcome) attempts at light-hearted humor. Despite formidable ensemble casting work, they always seem just&nbsp;like kids, instead of young people who want to be killer adults. A gap in the story develops—knighthood never registers as a&nbsp;fun concept, instead it's an obligation by parents.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;For all the power that comes with being a knight, it equates knighthood&nbsp;with getting through&nbsp;a standardized test.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqedpJu5qsTSZquhnV2hsrXAxKtkn6eiYsGpsYykoKefXay%2FqsDTnqVmr5mptW65xJ2gnq6RoXqkuMicn56r</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-single-shot-2013.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Single Shot movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2013)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-goodman-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Goodman Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
