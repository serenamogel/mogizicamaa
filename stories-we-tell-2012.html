The surprises do not operate as cheap "Gotcha" moments, but instead draw back veils to show levels, shades, nuances. Diane Polley comes to us in fragments, and we are forced to re-adjust our interpretation of her throughout the film as new details are revealed. At one point, one of Polley's interview subjects balks at the idea of having <i>everyone</i> tell the same story. As far as he is concerned, only two people have the "right" to tell that story, and it is the two people involved. Otherwise, he says, "you can't ever touch bottom." Inadvertently, in his criticism, he expresses Polley's whole theme.</p><p>Polley calls her interview subjects "The Storytellers," and they include her older sisters, Susy and Joanna, and her older brothers, John and Mark, and other important figures in her mother's past. Polley has said she was not interested in being an "omniscient" presence, and we can hear Polley's questions and laughter from behind the camera. Her father, Michael Polley, is an actor as well (familiar to anyone who was a fan of the Canadian TV series <i>Slings and Arrows</i>, where, incidentally, Sarah Polley had a role in the third season). "Stories We Tell" begins with Sarah setting up her father in a recording booth, to do the narration for the film, which (we find out later) he wrote. So there is already a distancing element in place. It's a film about making a film, and, as Polley tells her father, she sees the interviews as a kind of "interrogation process."</p><p>She asks each storyteller to "tell the story from the beginning until now," and as they begin, hesitantly at first, Polley supplements the story with old photographs and home movies: beautiful footage of her mother, cavorting on the beach, laughing at parties or around the pool, and, fascinatingly, singing "Ain't Misbehavin'" in what looks like an old black-and-white audition tape. Diane Polley is described by one and all as a woman who wanted to live life to the fullest. One person says that her walk was so emphatic "she made the record skip," an eloquent image. One family friend admits in an interview that she always sensed that Diane "had secrets," which turns out to be true. She was an actress, but she gave that up to have her family. The marriage to Michael was happy at first, but discontent grew. Michael was a solitary type of guy, and Diane loved crowds and excitement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq6iqmZrAbsPEZquepJxif3F9kQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-nightmare-before-christmas-meet-the-voices-behind-the-characters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Nightmare Before Christmas: Meet the Voices Behind the Characters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./msi-goes-compact-with-new-geforce-rtx-40series-gaming-slim-cards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MSI Goes Compact with New GeForce RTX 40-Series Gaming Slim Cards</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brian-westbrook-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Brian Westbrook Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-happened-to-judy-garlands-role-in-royal-wedding.html>What Happened To Judy Garland's Role In Royal Wedding?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gordon-liu.html>Gordon Liu</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./theres-something-about-mary-1998.html>There's Something About Mary movie review (1998)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-hogan-net-worth-134990.html>Chris Hogan Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
