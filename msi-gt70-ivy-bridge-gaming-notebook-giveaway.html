The system comes with an insane amount of memory - 12GB of DDR3-1600. There's a 750GB 7200RPM internal hard drive with more than enough space for all of your games. As a gaming notebook, it's no surprise that MSI outfitted the GT70 with a GeForce GTX 670M (40nm GF110 based design) and 3GB of GDDR5. By all accounts this should be one powerful gaming notebook.
